# WSO2 Inicialization Scripts

Those scripts were created to facilitade my daily routine with WSO2 products. They were made to be used in Linux as a service integration scripts.

Before execute then, be sure to execute chmod a+x command to turn then executable. And if you wanna work with then as a Linux service, create a symbolic link into /etc/init.d and have some fun!!!!!

sudo service service_name start|stop|restart|status

Enjoy!
